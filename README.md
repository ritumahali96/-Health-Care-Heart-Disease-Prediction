Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
We will be closely working with the heart disease prediction and for that, we will be looking into the heart disease dataset from that dataset we will derive various insights that help us know the weightage of each feature and how they are interrelated to each other but this time our sole aim is to detect the probability of person that will be affected by a savior heart problem or not.
## Takeaways
The Heart Disease prediction will have the following key takeaways:

1.Data insight: As mentioned here we will be working with the heart disease detection dataset and we will be putting out interesting inferences from the data to derive some meaningful results.
2.EDA: Exploratory data analysis is the key step for getting meaningful results.
3.Feature engineering: After getting the insights from the data we have to alter the features so that they can move forward for the model building phase.
4.Model building: In this phase, we will be building our Machine learning model for heart disease detection.

## Conclusion on Heart Disease Prediction
1. We did data visualization and data analysis of the target variable, age features, and whatnot along with its univariate analysis and bivariate analysis.

2. We also did a complete feature engineering part in this article which summons all the valid steps needed for further steps i.e.
model building.

3. From the above model accuracy, Logistic Regression is giving us the accuracy which is 89%.
